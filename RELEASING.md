1. Bump `com.twilio % guardrail` version in `modules/core/build.sbt`

2. Grab the associated release text from [twilio/guardrail/releases](https://github.com/twilio/guardrail/releases)

3. Create a release tag: [link](https://github.com/twilio/sbt-guardrail/releases)

4. Once the tag is created, travis-ci will start building a release immediately.
   Artifacts should be published to sonatype automatically.
